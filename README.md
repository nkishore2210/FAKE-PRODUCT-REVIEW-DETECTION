# FAKE PRODUCT USER-REVIEW DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

## ABOUT

The rise of e-commerce has led to an influx of fake reviews designed to mislead buyers and distort product ratings. This project leverages advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to detect fake reviews, promoting trust and transparency in online marketplaces.

Our solution integrates a user-friendly web interface with a robust backend powered by NLP and machine learning algorithms to classify reviews as genuine or fake.

## FEATURES

1. Real-Time Review Analysis: Detect fake reviews instantly using advanced ML models.
   
2. High Accuracy: Employs Voting Ensemble (XGBoost and Random Forest) with an accuracy of 88.11%.
 
3. Scalable and Adaptive: Handles large datasets and adapts to new patterns in fake reviews.
  
4. Intuitive Web Interface: Submit individual reviews or batch files for analysis.
   
5. Explainability: Provides confidence scores for every prediction.

## REQUIREMENTS

### HARDWARE
Processor: Dual Core, 2.0 GHz
RAM: 2 GB (minimum)
Storage: 120 GB

### SOFTWARE
OS: Windows 7/8/10/11
Python 3.8+
